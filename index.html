                        the night sky and the patterns that can be found around the sun, moon, and stars.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">In the Sky</span> is the anchor text for this set. Depending on the needs of
                        your class, you may choose to assign <span class="bold">In the Sky</span> for independent
                        reading, or you may
                        choose to read it aloud with the class. Beginning with the anchor text will ground students in
                        concepts and academic vocabulary that are key to discussing the Big Question. As students read
                        the other texts in the set, they will compare their new understandings, as well as the structure
                        and features of the text, with the anchor text.</p>
                    <p>After students read the anchor text, you may choose to assign specific texts or encourage
                        students to choose the texts that appeal to them the most. Use the chart below to see where
                        specific text features and text structures appear across the texts in this set.

                            carefully. What do you notice when you observe the moon in the sky?</span> Or: <span

                    <p>[a word web with <i>phase</i> in the center, and with <i>full moon, new moon, crescent,</i> and

                        might be familiar to most students, but other texts in this set include words that might be new
                        or challenging. During class discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become
                        familiar with them. For example: <span class="blue_scripting">When we <span

                    <p>This informational text shows, through text and images, how looking through a telescope makes
                        distant objects in the night sky easier to see, and with greater detail.</p>
                    <h2 id="scrollTop_s6_3">Before Reading</h2>
                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold">Big Question</span></h3>
                    <p>Remind students of the Big Question: What can we learn
                        from observing the night sky? Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">How do you think Through a
                            Telescope will relate to the Big Question?</span></p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold">Preview Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p>Have students find and read sentences in the text that have the words stars, telescope, moon, and
                        planet. Discuss the meaning of each word with the class.</p>
                    <p>Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What can you see when you look up at the night sky? Can you see
                            the moon? Can you see any planets? Have you ever used a <span class="bold">telescope</span>
                            to see far away things?</span></p>
                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold">Oral Vocabulary</h3>
                    <p>Through a Telescope includes vocabulary that might be
                        new or challenging for students. During class discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to
                        help students become familiar with them. For example: <span class="blue_scripting">When we <span
                                class="bold">observe</span> something, we look at it carefully. How does making
                            something look bigger help you observe it?</span> </p>
                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold">Word Web</span></h3>
                    <p>Share a Word Web graphic organizer. To help students think about the relationships between words,
                        guide them in creating a word web using the word <i>telescope</i>. When they read <i>Through a
                            Telescope</i>, encourage them to add words to their web that relate to the word
                        <i>telescope</i>. A web for <i>telescope</i> might look like this:
                    </p>
                    <p>[a word web with <i>telescope</i> in the center, and with <i>moon, Saturn, planets, stars,</i>

                    <p>An important part of building a vibrant classroom culture is creating an atmosphere in which all
                        students feel empowered to participate in powerful classroom conversation. You may have noticed
                        that
                        your students who are naturally extroverted often participate freely in a whole-class
                        discussion,
                        while those who are more introverted or, perhaps, who come from cultures that respect different
                        classroom norms, may need encouragement to share. You can use sentence prompts like these to
                        invite
                        all students into the conversation:</p>
                    <p>“That’s so interesting … please tell me more!”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone explain that in a different way?”</p>
                    <p>“What are some examples of that?”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone add on to that idea?”</p>
                    <p>Sharing and discussing ideas will often involve agreeing and/or disagreeing with what others say.
                        As
                        students listen carefully and respond thoughtfully to their classmates’ ideas, encourage them to
                        express themselves in respectful and constructive ways. You may wish to post these sentence
                        starters
                        prominently, so students can refer to them often:</p>
                    <p>“I agree, and I also think <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl">__________</span> .”</p>
                    <p>“I mostly agree, but <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl">__________</span> .”</p>
                    <p>“I like what you just said because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl">__________</span> .”</p>
                    <p>“I respectfully disagree because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl">__________</span> .”</p>
