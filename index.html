                    <p>This text set includes four informational texts and a video. All deal with an aspect of observing the night sky and the patterns that can be found around the sun, moon, and stars.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">In the Sky</span> is the anchor text for this set. Depending on the needs of your class, you may choose to assign <span>In the Sky</span> for independent reading, or you may choose to read it aloud with the class. Beginning with the anchor text will ground students in concepts and academic vocabulary that are key to discussing the Big Question. As students read the other texts in the set, they will compare their new understandings, as well as the structure and features of the text, with the anchor text.</p>
                    <p>After students read the anchor text, you may choose to assign specific texts or encourage students to choose the texts that appeal to them the most. Use the chart below to see where specific text features, text structures, and content topics appear across the texts in this set.</p>

                    <p>Now that the class has read some or all of the texts in this set, it is time to pull together all the information they have learned from their reading in order to explore and share their evolving understanding of the Big Question.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Vocabulary Round-Up</h2>
                    <p><span class="bold">Word Sort</span> Have students review the word webs they have created for the texts they have read, and then do a word sort, identifying new connections between the words using all the information they now have from their reading. For example, students might connect the words crescent, full moon, gibbous, phase, and moon, as they're all related to phases of the moon.</p>
                    <p>Ask students to share their word sorts and explain why they connected the words the way they did. Students may sort words based on their own experiences, so accept all reasonable explanations for the connections they make.</p>
                    <h2>Discuss The Text Set's Big Question</h2>
                    <p>Guide a class discussion around the Big Question: <i>What can we learn by observing the night sky?</i> Encourage students to bring in knowledge they have learned from all the texts they have read in the text set, using as many of the words from their word webs as they can. </p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Sky Tour!</span></p>
                    <p>Have students draw a picture of the night sky. Ask them to make sure they include at least three objects they read about in this text set.</p>
                    <p>Have them plan and practice how they would give a tour of the night sky. What would they say about each thing in the sky? What interesting information from their reading would they share?</p>
                    <p>Students can refer to what they wrote in Write About the Big Question for each text to aid their thinking and planning. They may also use the <a href="#">Project Template</a> to help them organize and clarify their thinking as they plan their projects. Encourage them to use the vocabulary they’ve learned from the texts in their tours.</p>
                    <p>When they are finished planning their tours, provide students with a variety of settings in which they can share their tours, such as in a small group setting, for the whole class, or with a single partner.</p>
