                    <p><span class="bold">In the Sky</span> is the anchor text for this set. Depending on the needs of
                        your class, you may choose to assign <span>In the Sky</span> for independent reading, or you may
                        choose to read it aloud with the class. Beginning with the anchor text will ground students in
                        concepts and academic vocabulary that are key to discussing the Big Question. As students read
                        the other texts in the set, they will compare their new understandings, as well as the structure
                        and features of the text, with the anchor text.</p>
                    <p>After students read the anchor text, you may choose to assign specific texts or encourage
                        students to choose the texts that appeal to them the most. Use the chart below to see where
                        specific text features, text structures, and content topics appear across the texts in this set.

                    <p>Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What <span class="bold">shapes</span> have you seen in the clouds? Have you ever made <span class="bold">shapes</span> by playing connect the dots? What shapes do you see when you observe the <span class="bold">stars</span>?</span></p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Oral Vocabulary</span> <i>Star Pictures</i> includes some words that might be new or challenging to students. During class discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span class="blue_scripting">An <span class="bold">astronomer</span> is someone who studies the stars. If you were an astronomer, what would you try to learn about stars?</span> </p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Word Web</span></p>
                    <p>Share a Word Web graphic organizer. To help students think about the relationships between words, guide them in creating a word web using the word <i>star</i>. When they read <i>Star Pictures,</i> encourage them to add words to their web that relate to the word star. A web for <i>star</i> might look like this: </p>
                    <p>[a word web with <i>star</i> in the center, and with <i>night, sky, space, shapes,</i> branching from it]</p>

                    <p>Now that the class has read some or all of the texts in this set, it is time to pull together all
                        the information they have learned from their reading in order to explore and share their
                        evolving understanding of the Big Question.</p>

                    <h2>Vocabulary Round-Up</h2>
                    <p><span class="bold">Word Sort</span> Have students review the word webs they have created for the
                        texts they have read, and then do a word sort, identifying new connections between the words
                        using all the information they now have from their reading. For example, students might connect
                        the words crescent, full moon, gibbous, phase, and moon, as they're all related to phases of the
                        moon.</p>
                    <p>Ask students to share their word sorts and explain why they connected the words the way they did.
                        Students may sort words based on their own experiences, so accept all reasonable explanations
                        for the connections they make.</p>
                    <h2>Discuss The Text Set's Big Question</h2>
                    <p>Guide a class discussion around the Big Question: <i>What can we learn by observing the night
                            sky?</i> Encourage students to bring in knowledge they have learned from all the texts they
                        have read in the text set, using as many of the words from their word webs as they can. </p>
                    <ul class="small-bullet">
                        <li>What did you already know about things in the sky before you began reading this text set?

                    <p>Have students apply what they’ve learned from the text set to demonstrate and enhance their
                        understanding. Review the <a href="#">Project Rubric</a> with students, explaining in detail the
                        expectations for the project.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Sky Tour!</span></p>
                    <p>Have students draw a picture of the night sky. Ask them to make sure they include at least three
                        objects they read about in this text set.</p>
                    <p>Have them plan and practice how they would give a tour of the night sky. What would they say
                        about each thing in the sky? What interesting information from their reading would they share?
                    </p>
                    <p>Students can refer to what they wrote in Write About the Big Question for each text to aid their
                        thinking and planning. They may also use the <a href="#">Project Template</a> to help them
                        organize and clarify their thinking as they plan their projects. Encourage them to use the
                        vocabulary they’ve learned from the texts in their tours.</p>
                    <p>When they are finished planning their tours, provide students with a variety of settings in which
                        they can share their tours, such as in a small group setting, for the whole class, or with a
                        single partner.</p>
